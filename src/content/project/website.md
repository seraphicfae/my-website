## Hello! Hi! haiii!!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is where I host my personal projects.
I rebuilt the site using <u>[Astro](https://astro.build)</u> to learn about it.
I've been doing this website stuff since I was 11-12, coding on school chromebooks on VsCode web version,
making little projects. I first learned web development through w3schools (huge shoutout to them<3)
Later I moved on to discord bots, coding on a laptop I was given. Shitty HP Pavilion; overpriced "gaming"
laptop. Started using actual VScode and JavaScript. Discord.js v11, my beloved<3

Curious how I made this site? \
Check out the source code on <u>[GitHub](https://github.com/seraphicfae/website)</u>
